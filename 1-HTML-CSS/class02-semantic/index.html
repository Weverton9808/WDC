            Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead <br />
            I found a girl, beautiful and sweet <br />
            I never knew you were the someone waiting for me <br />

            'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love <br />
            Not knowing what it was <br />
            I will not give you up this time <br />
            Darling, just kiss me slow <br />
            Your heart is all I own<br />
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine<br />

            Baby I'm, dancing in the dark<br />
            With you between my arms<br />
            Barefoot on the grass<br />
            Listening to, our favorite song<br />
            When you said you, looked a mess<br />
            I whispered underneath my breath<br />
            But you heard it<br />
            Darling you, look perfect tonight <br />

            I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br />
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br />
            I found a lover to carry more than just my secrets<br />
            To carry love, to carry children of our own <br />

            We are still kids, but we're so in love<br />
            Fighting against all odds<br />
            I know we'll be alright this time<br />
            Darling, just hold my hand<br />
            Be my girl, I'll be your man <br />
            I see my future in your eyes <br />
